## Am I the only freelancer suffering from a decreasing demand?

Are you no longer receiving propositions as frequently as before? 
Is the client's sole focus securing the lowest rate possible?
Are projects now shorter in duration?
And what about remote job offers? Have they decreased even more compared to pre-pandemic times? 

Can we blame intermediaries for this situation? 
Is the market overcrowded with individuals leaving their jobs and taking advantage of "chômage"?

**The goal of this page is to provide you with an overview of the demand for IT freelancers in France. It may not fully reflect the market, as it is based on the information we could gather from various sources.**
Now, let's examine the extent of the damage, who is affected, and what the current demand looks like.

## Perimeter
Date: From May 2023

Projects: 7048 job offers for freelancers in IT / Tech / Data ![Type of projects](_includes/img/wordcloud_projects.png)

## Remontada?
After a very shy month of May that demotivated us all, the week of June 12th marked a strong resurgence with 2.5 times more assignments compared to the previous week.

## And the rates?
Since we don't have data before May 2023 and the evolutions can be observed on the yearly level, we can't conclude that much on the rates.
*We are working on finding more historical data"

![Rates' evolutions](/rates.png)
In the actual market, you "only" gain 30% when you go from junior to expert, which is less than 3% per additional year of experience.

## Who do they want?
55% of the last 6 weeks projects are for freelancers with 5 - 10 years of experience, followed by the 2 - 5 years of experience with 33% of the projects.
If you are a junior, you only have access to 5% of the projects. When you are an expert, you get 8% of the demand.

## Where do they want them?
Freelancing is still very centralized around Paris and its region:
- 54% of the projects of the last 6 months were located in Paris and Île-de-France
- followed by Lille and Hauts-de-France region with 11% of the projects
- and then Lyon and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes with 7%

Only 5.5% of the projects can be done **full remote**, and in average the rate is 4% lower for a full remote project!

## How long are the projects?
This analysis doesn't take into account the specificity of each job, but in average and in this short period of time, the projects' length is around 100 to 120 days.

## Backlog of analysis
That's all for today :)
Next steps: 
- Update the data every week
- Do some NLP on the job descriptions and titles to identify the most popular technologies and positions and their evolution
- Maybe add other geographies
