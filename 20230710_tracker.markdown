## Am I the only freelancer suffering from a decreasing demand?

Are you no longer receiving propositions as frequently as before? 
Is the client's sole focus securing the lowest rate possible?
Are projects now shorter in duration?
And what about remote job offers? Have they decreased even more compared to pre-pandemic times? 

Can we blame intermediaries for this situation? 
Is the market overcrowded with individuals leaving their jobs and taking advantage of "chômage"?

**The goal of this page is to provide you with an overview of the demand for IT freelancers in France. It may not fully reflect the market, as it is based on the information we could gather from various sources.**
Now, let's examine the extent of the damage, who is affected, and what the current demand looks like.

## Perimeter
Date: From May 2023

Projects: 10404 job offers for freelancers in IT / Tech / Data ![Type of projects](/wordcloud_projects.png)

## Back on tracks
Number of IT projects for freelancers in France has been on an increasing trend for 2 weeks. This might be due to the last preparations for September's projects before July and August's holidays.

## And the rates?
Since we don't have data before May 2023 and usually rates' evolutions can be observed on the yearly level, we can't conclude that much on the rates. But we actualized the chart with the latest data.
*We are working on finding more historical data"

## Who do they want?
The demand does not seem to have high fluctuations when it comes to the experience wanted for the projects.
Last week, 54% of the projects were for freelancers with 5 - 10 years of experience.
Followed by 2 - 5 years of experience with 34% of the projects.
If you are a junior, you only have access to 3% of last week's projects. When you are an expert, you get 9% of the demand.

## Where do they want them?
Freelancing is still very centralized around Paris and its region,- 55% of the projects of the last 8 weeks were located in Paris and Île-de-France.
Overall, the share of projects in Paris and its region has been increasing during the last weeks with a slight decrease the week of July 3rd.

Only 4% of the projects can be done **full remote** (last week it was 5%). Are remote projects set to disappear?

## Backlog of analysis
That's all for today :)
Next steps: 
- Update the data every week
- Do some NLP on the job descriptions and titles to identify the most popular technologies and positions and their evolution
- Maybe add other geographies
