## Am I the only freelancer suffering from a decreasing demand?

Are you no longer receiving propositions as frequently as before? 
Is the client's sole focus securing the lowest rate possible?
Are projects now shorter in duration?
And what about remote job offers? Have they decreased even more compared to pre-pandemic times? 

Can we blame intermediaries for this situation? 
Is the market overcrowded with individuals leaving their jobs and taking advantage of "ch√¥mage"?

**The goal of this page is to provide you with an overview of the demand for IT freelancers in France. It may not fully reflect the market, as it is based on the information we could gather from various sources.**
Now, let's examine the extent of the damage, who is affected, and what the current demand looks like.

## Perimeter
Date: From May 2023

Projects: 11537 job offers for freelancers in IT / Tech / Data

## Back on tracks
Number of IT projects for freelancers in France has been on an increasing trend for 2 weeks, but a decrease has been observed last week.
We are keeping up with a rythm of more than 10 000 publication a week.
August is predicted to be at very low publications level, these are the last week for you to prepare the September come back.

## And the rates?
Since we don't have data before May 2023 and usually rates' evolutions can be observed on the yearly level, we can't conclude that much on the rates. But we actualized the chart with the latest data.
*We are working on finding more historical data"


## Who do they want?
The demand does not seem to have high fluctuations when it comes to the experience wanted for the projects.
Last week, 54% of the projects were for freelancers with 5 - 10 years of experience.
Followed by 2 - 5 years of experience with 34% of the projects.
If you are a junior, you only have access to 3% of last week's projects. When you are an expert, you get 9% of the demand.

## Focus Remote
A slight increase in the full remote projects was observed.
Less than one fourth of full remote projects are related to SAP.
43% of the full remote projects last at least one year.

## Backlog of analysis
That's all for today :)
Next steps: 
- Update the data every week
- Do some NLP on the job descriptions and titles to identify the most popular technologies and positions and their evolution
- Maybe add other geographies
