# Conviction
At the Kollektiv D., we firmly believe in the following principles:
 - Data skills are most effective when coupled with functional expertise and sectorial understanding.
 - Data is not an end in itself, but an approach to inform decision-making.
 - Organizations that effectively leverage data today gain a competitive advantage over their peers.
 - To generate impactful insights for organizations, data and insights must have meaning and context.
 - This meaning and context are provided by functional and sectorial skills.
 - We do not believe in Data Labs as separate entities that consist solely of data engineers, data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers, serving as providers to other business functions.
 - Data skills are integral to all professions.
 - In the next 10 years, data skills will become as essential as Excel, PowerPoint, and other office tools. 
 - Data literacy will be a standard requirement.
 - Considering data as an optional layer to sprinkle on top does not work.
 - Conversely, neglecting data and failing to recognize its strong return on investment does not work.
 - Members of the Kollektiv D. possess both sectorial and functional expertise, as well as data skills.
 
The Kollektiv D. embraces these principles and aims to empower individuals who share this strong conviction.
