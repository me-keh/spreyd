# Conviction
At the Kollektiv D., we firmly believe:
 - Data skills are most effective when coupled with functional expertise and sectorial understanding.
 - Data is not an end in itself, but an approach to inform decision-making.
 - Organizations that effectively leverage data today gain a competitive advantage over their peers.
 - To generate impactful insights for organizations, data and insights must have meaning and context.
 - This meaning and context are provided by functional and sectorial skills.
 - We do not believe in Data Labs as separate entities serving as providers to other business functions.
 - Data skills are integral to all professions.
 - In the next 10 years, data skills will become as essential as Excel, PowerPoint, and other office tools. 
 - Data literacy will be a standard requirement.
 - Considering data as an optional layer to sprinkle on top does not work.
 - Conversely, neglecting data and failing to recognize its strong return on investment does not work.
 - Members of the Kollektiv D. possess both sectorial and functional expertise, as well as data skills.
 - The Kollektiv D. is anti data-sprinkling, the Kollektiv D. is pro data-spreading.
 - The business name of Kollektiv D. is SPREYD
 
The Kollektiv D. embraces these principles and aims to empower individuals who share this strong conviction.

# Duties
At Kollektiv D., we only do two things:

**Build a strong commercial approach**

Without a strong commercial approach, we can be stuck with unsatisfying projects.

Without a strong commercial approach, we are seen as commodities.

Without a strong commercial approach, we leave value to intermediaries who can sell.

We want to take control over our careers and maximize our potential.

To succeed, we need to be able to sell. Sell our profiles, sell projects. 

We will hunt together. Share our networks. Elaborate projects.

**Impose our vision**

We are determined to challenge the dominant discourse of "data sprinkling." 

We reject the superficial application of data.

We want to change the narrative and advocate for our vision of data-spreading. 

We do this by creating impactful content, lobbying for our cause, and leading the way with our ideas. 

Our goal is to shift the way people think about data skills.
