## Am I the only freelancer suffering from a decreasing demand?

Are you no longer receiving propositions as frequently as before?
Is the client's sole focus securing the lowest rate possible?
Are projects now shorter in duration?
And what about remote job offers? Have they decreased even more compared to pre-pandemic times?

Can we blame intermediaries for this situation?
